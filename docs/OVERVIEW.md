# AddressAlarm Overview

AddressAlarm is an Android accessibility companion that keeps a private, on-device watchlist of locations you want to avoid or approach with caution. When you open a supported navigation, gig, or mapping app and an address from your list appears on screen, AddressAlarm raises a visible, debounced alert so you can make safer choices in the moment.

## Who it is for
- **Gig workers and delivery drivers** who regularly encounter unfamiliar addresses.
- **Public safety and social service professionals** visiting residences under unpredictable conditions.
- **Real estate, utilities, and contractor teams** juggling large route lists.
- **Anyone** who wants a personal safety net for risky or sensitive locations.

## Core capabilities
- 100% on-device comparison â€” no network access or cloud sync required.
- Customizable address entries with tags to note why a location is risky.
- Debounced alerts that minimize notification fatigue.
- Per-app visibility controls so only trusted apps are monitored.
- Import/export workflow for backing up or sharing watchlists between devices.

## Project status
AddressAlarm is under active development. The foundational alerting pipeline is in place, and the next milestones focus on fuzzy matching improvements, encrypted storage, voice feedback, and broader distribution.
