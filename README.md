# AddressAlarm 🚨

**AddressAlarm** is an open-source Android app that helps anyone flag and avoid risky, curious or problematic addresses.
It runs **100% on-device**, watching for addresses through Accessibility, and alerts you when a location matches your personal "do-not-enter" or "use caution" list.

##  🚨 ***Test build label:*** The current pre-release APK installs under the launcher codename: **FlagDrive** 
### You will see this name when granting permissions or enabling the accessibility service. The branding will switch to AddressAlarm in a future build. 🚨

Originally designed with gig workers in mind, the tool now serves a much broader purpose — useful for **law enforcement, social workers, real estate agents, contractors, utility workers, and the general public** who want a personal safety layer for navigating locations.
