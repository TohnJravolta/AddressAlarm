# AddressAlarm

AddressAlarm is an open-source Android app that helps anyone avoid risky, curious, or problematic addresses. The app runs entirely on-device, watching for locations through Android accessibility services and alerting you whenever a monitored app shows an address on your personal watchlist.

Originally designed with gig workers in mind, AddressAlarm now supports law enforcement, social workers, real estate agents, contractors, utility workers, and the public at large.

**Latest build:** https://github.com/TohnJravolta/AddressAlarm/releases/tag/v0.2.42

## Highlights in v0.2.42

- Per-app monitoring controls let you choose exactly which navigation, gig, or messaging apps AddressAlarm watches.
- SQLCipher-backed storage keeps the watchlist encrypted with a key that only the device can unlock.
- Delete confirmations (single and bulk) prevent accidental data loss.
- The in-app support dialog links directly to the maintainer's Ko-fi for voluntary support.
- A first-run license screen bundles the full LICENSE text with a plain-language summary so acceptance is stored locally.
