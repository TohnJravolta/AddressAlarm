# AddressAlarm 🚨

**AddressAlarm** is an open-source Android app that helps anyone flag and avoid risky, curious or problematic addresses.  
It runs **100% on-device**, watching for addresses through Accessibility, and alerts you when a location matches your personal "do-not-enter" or "use caution" list.

Originally designed with gig workers in mind, the tool now serves a much broader purpose — useful for **law enforcement, social workers, real estate agents, contractors, utility workers, and the general public** who want a personal safety layer for navigating locations.
